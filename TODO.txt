- use pyDBoW to retrieve overlapping frames during kf insertion and triangulate new world points from overlap
- merge world points and add an index to pose graph for the visible world points in each key frame


0) Improve initialization
- perform full BA after first two KFs and initial map are estimated

1) Improvement of Frame-to-Frame Pose Estimation
- match features in current frame with features in last KF
- get course pose estimate of current frame by solving PnP with 3D map points corresponding to matched features
- project local submap into current frame
- find further matches between map point of local submap and features in current frame
- solve PnP with all matches to get a better pose estimate (or alternatively perform BA with fixed map points)

2) Improvement of KF insertion
- add additional criteria to KF insertion, e.g. 20 frames must have passed before a new KF is inserted
- do not perform triangulation of new map points with the previous KF but with the KF that has the most similar pose to the new KF
- perform epipolar search between the new KF and the reference KF to find additional matches
- triangulate matches to create new map points

other: Track quality supervision:
- Monitor quality of tracking with every frame by computing the ratio of matched feature points to total feature points
- If quality falls below threshold, continue tracking but do not insert new KFs into map
- If quality is even lower for several subsequent frames, tracking is lost and relocalization needs to be performed
